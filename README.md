Your dotfiles repository might include your shell aliases and preferences, any tools you want to install, or any other codespace personalization you want to make.

When you create a new codespace, GitHub clones your dotfiles repository to the codespace environment, and looks for one of the following files to set up the environment.

- install.sh
- install
- bootstrap.sh
- bootstrap
- script/bootstrap
- setup.sh
- setup
- script/setup
